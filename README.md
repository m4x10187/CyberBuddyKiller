### Description:
This simple Batch script was made sometime around 2020, its purpose was to fully remove ["CyberBuddy"](http://thecyberbuddy.com/) from my computer, since it didn't come with any uninstallation program once you've installed it.

### NOTE:
The script will only work with operating systems running Windows XP and above, anything lower than that will not work. Refer to the alternative removal instruction guide for those who are running Windows 9x up to Windows 2000.

### Instructions:
Right-click on "CyberBudKill.bat" and run the script as an administrator, then follow the on-screen instructions.
